# spring-boot-graphql
In this project I realize the simple application to show GraphQL Server with Spring Boot Application.

# run in the first time
If you run in the first time application and want to see the testing data, just open the root file - `GrapgqldemoApplication`, and uncomment `CommandLineRunner`.

# Running
To run the application enter in the command line: `mvn spring-boot:run`
